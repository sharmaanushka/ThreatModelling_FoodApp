# ThreatModelling_FoodApp
Threat Modelling Using STRIDE and PASTA- A case study on a Food Delivery App.
This is a security case study demonstrating two threat modelling frameworks- **STRIDE** and **PASTA**- applied to a fictional food delivery app (like Swiggy/Zomato).

## Objectives
- Learn and apply STRIDE to classify threat
- Use PASTA for attack simulation  and risk analysis
- Identify mitigations for each threat

## Frameworks Used
- STRIDE (by Microsoft)
- PASTA (Process for attack simulation and threat analysis)

## Contents
- STRIDE/-> Threat table, mitigations, diagrams
- PASTA/->Risk steps, simulations, business impact
- diagrams/-> System + data flow diagrams
